PROJECT TITLE: Unit Test Example
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Chapter 14 - Testing. Example of Unit Testing
VERSION or DATE: 05/2011
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: see below
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

This example demonstrates two types of unit testing, one created by
the user and which can be executed from the command line 
using "java TestDriver" and one that should be executed out of an
IDE that has the JUnit testing harness installed. 

In BlueJ JUnit is installed by default. A JUnit <<unit test>> class
will appear and right-clicking on the class will allow you to select
which test to run.

Both tests do exactly the same thing.
